Write a detailed Pull Request description that addresses the following:
- What has changed between his feature branch and the dev branch
- Checklist of prerequisites (e.g. added documentation, added tests, ready to merge, etc.)
- How to use the feature (a GIF of the feature in action is extremely useful here)
- How the design has changed and how it compares to the design mockups (screenshots comparing the designs to the implementation)
- Additional notes the reviewers should be made aware of
